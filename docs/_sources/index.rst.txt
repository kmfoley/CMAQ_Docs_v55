CMAQ: The Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System
==========================================================


**CMAQ:** an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations. CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling, multi-processor computing techniques, and an open source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone, particulates, toxics and acid deposition.  See <https://epa.gov/cmaq>.
